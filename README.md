# TicTacToeInfinite
Expandable Tic Tac Toe Game Using Java

To play compile this in a java compiler (I used eclipse) and run. This is a tic tic toe game that can have a 150 by 150 board (technically not infinite due to memory and runtime but more than most people need) and you can control the number of x's or o's in a row (vertically, horiztonally, or diagaonally) needed to win, you can play with an "AI" or another player. Use the console to play.
 
Sorry for any spaghetti code this was made in my sophomore year of high school, so feel free to modify it. Also feel free to view any other projects I made.
